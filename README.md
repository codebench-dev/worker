# CodeBench worker

The worker handles lifecycle of an execution job.

- Get jobs from a Redis queues
- Fire up a Firecracker microVM for each job
- Run job trough the [agent](https://github.com/codebench-esgi/agent)
- Update back a Redis queue for each job during the process, with the following statuses:
  - `received`
  - `running`
  - `failed`
  - `done` + stdout/stderr

## Requirements

- The `firecracker` binary in the `PATH`
- A rootfs in `../agent/rootfs.ext4` with the [agent](https://github.com/codebench-esgi/agent) installed and enabled at boot
- A Linux kernel at `../../linux/vmlinux`.

Both the rootfs and the kernel can be built with scripts in the linked repo.

## Demo

Start Redis:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Start the worker:

```
Â» go run
Waiting for jobs on redis job queue
```

Add a job to a Redis list (here, `uname -a`)

```
127.0.0.1:6378> RPUSH jobs '{"id":"666", "command": "uname -a"}'
(integer) 1
```

The worker gets the job, starts a goroutine to handle it:

```

Done! The job has been handled, the microVM has been shut down and the job output has been published to redis. The output here is `Linux 192.168.127.83 5.9.0 #1 SMP Sun May 2 19:10:27 UTC 2021 x86_64 Linux`.

Here's what happening on Redis during that time:
